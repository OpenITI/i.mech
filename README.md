OpenITI (2020.2.3) Instantiation with texts split into 300w chunks (500 chunks max per file). The texts here are in their original format, but split into 300 milestones. (@) and (@@) are used for `\n` and for `\n#` respectively (since new lines are difficult to preserve in a CSV format without breaking it).
