OpenITI, latest version ([2023.1.8](https://zenodo.org/records/10007820)), Instantiation with texts split into 300w chunks (300 chunks max per file). The texts here are in their original format, but split into 300 milestones. (@) and (@@) are used for `\n` and for `\n#` respectively (since new lines are difficult to preserve in a CSV format without breaking it).
