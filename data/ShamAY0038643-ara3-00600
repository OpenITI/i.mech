This is the reason that in Arabic it applies to both, masculine as well as feminine. Man is the Zauj of woman and woman is the Zauj of a man. In any case, here it means the Prophet's wives who are eleven in number. Two of them had died during the lifetime of the Prophet (PBUH) and nine survived after him. Islam does not permit more than four wives to a Muslim but the Prophet (PBUH) was given the exclusive permission for numerous considerations which have been discussed by religious scholars at length.(@)(@@) This Hadith also refutes the opinion of those who do not include his pious wives in the category of his "Al''. The progeny of the Prophet (PBUH) includes his male and female children and their descendants. But after his death none except Fatimah (May Allah be pleased with her) and her children remained alive.

According to some scholars, `Faith'' means Salat. This is also the sense in which it has been used in the Qur'an: "And Allah would never make your Faith to be lost (i.e., your prayers).'' [2:143]. Thus when Salat is the Faith, the purification is a prerequisite for Salat. Salat is not valid without purification.

It is like the saying of the Prophet (PBUH) that "Hajj is `Arafah'', which means that `Arafat (the place where the pilgrims stay on the 9th day of Dhul- Hijjah) is the most important element of the Hajj. Thus, this Hadith stresses the importance and merits of purification and offers an inducement for it. It also mentions the eminence of the invocations mentioned in the Hadith by saying that if they are given a form, they will fill the space between the heavens and the earth.

Along with this conviction one should do good deeds which please Allah and avoid such deeds which have been prohibited by Him. With this conduct, one should hope for the best from Allah. This approach is similar to that of a cultivator who ploughs his land, sows the seed, waters it, takes every possible care of it and then cherishes hope for a good crop. It can also be linked to the endeavours of a person who intends to become a scholar, or a physician or an engineer. The first and foremost requirement to pursue his ambition is to study the books through which he can gain the required knowledge. For every work one intends to do, one has to first make a foundation and then acquire the means essential for it. It is only then that one can hope to achieve one's aim.(@)(@@) Similar is the case of associating good hopes with Allah. Unless a person does not furnish the foundation of Faith and good deeds for it, it will be unwise to associate good hopes with Allah. A slave who rather than serving his master runs away or annoys him and still hopes that his master being so kind will not take him to task for his excesses would be called stupid by the people. The same is true of Allah, who is certainly the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful and Forgiving. But for whom is He so? The answer is for His faithful and obedient slaves and not for those who are followers of Satan. For Satan and his followers, Allah's Decision is that: "I will fill Hell with you (Iblis) and those of them (mankind) that follow you, together.''

These Divine injunctions are of various kinds, i.e., some of them are obligatory, some desirable and some voluntary. The obligatory ones are compulsory and their compliance is indispensable. What is termed as Mustahabbat (desirables) are also highly important for gaining the Pleasure of Allah. Similarly, voluntary acts are a means of getting close to Allah. Ordinary people are sometimes puzzled by the abundance of the latter and want to adhere to the first two, that is obligations and what comes in the category of desirables. A desire to this effect is mentioned in this Hadith. The Prophet (PBUH) answered the query in this matter by saying to the inquirer, "Keep your tongue wet with the remembrance of Allah.'' Keeping the tongue wet with the remembrance of Allah here means its abundant recitation. In other words, one should make the remembrance of Allah a permanent feature. If one is not able to do many voulntary good works, which some people find difficult, the remembrance of Allah will make up the deficiency in that regard.(@)PageV01P1824(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1439 - وعن جابر رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ من قال : سبحان الله وبحمده غرست له نخلة في الجنة ] رواه الترمذي وقال حديث حسن(@)(@@) 1439.

Imam Al-Bukhari is also included among those who hold this view. They say that the words "at all times'' clearly means that. The Prophet (PBUH) used to remember Allah (which includes the recitation of the Qur'an also) no matter whether he was in a state of minor or major pollution. For this reason, Sheikh Al- Albani has objected Imam An-Nawawi's mentioning these two exceptions (pollution resulting from coition and menses) in the relevant title, and has stated that there is no Hadith in support of these exceptions. In fact, the Hadith narrated by `A ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) contradicts this view. In the opinion of this school of thought, the Ahadith which prohibit the remembrance of Allah when a person is in the state of Janabah are weak in authority and are open to discussion. Thus, such Ahadith do not prove the prohibition. In the opinion of the second school of thought, which holds the opposite view, such Ahadith carry weight despite being weak in authority, because their weakness is not serious. Some of them even believe that such Ahadith come to the level of Hadith Hasan. So far logic is concerned, the viewpoint of the first school carries more weight but the reverence of the Qur'an also calls for caution. The best way to create conformity between the two views is that in inevitable situations one may go by the first view but in the ordinary circumstances it is better to follow the second view.

The words such as Subhan-Allah, Al-hamdu lillah, La ilaha illallah, Allahu Akbar etc., are recited and Praise and Glorification of Allah are done after Salat. The groups are quietly engaged in the remembrance of Allah, and those who attend the sermons and speeches delivered in mosques on Friday also come in this category of meetings and gatherings as these are ordained in Islam.

Some people are of the opinion that it is synonymous with poverty combined with abundant children. But Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar is of the view that it is only one of the several kinds of "Troubles of a Trial.'' "Ash-Shaqa' is the opposite of good fortune, that is, to pray for protection from misfortune. No Decision of Allah is wrong but some of His Decisions may be harmful for certain people while others are beneficial for them. This means that their goodness or badness is related to persons. What it signifies is that one should pray to Allah to keep one safe from such decisions which are harmful for him. "Shamatat'' the pleasure that one's enemy feels on one's trouble. In other words, it is prayed that Allah may protect one from any such trouble which is pleasing to one's enemy, because when a person is in trouble, his enemies feel pleasure over it. In this Hadith, one sentence was added by Abu Sufyan and during his old age he did not remember which one it was. But we learn from other Ahadith that it was "the pleasure of enemies''. (Ibn `Allan). This Hadith also shows the honesty and integrity of the narrators of Ahadith. They were honest to the extent that if a few words of supplication were added to a Hadith by its narrators, they would point it out. Some scholars have regarded these words an addition in the Hadith by its narrator, who is otherwise reliable, but it is not a problem of "addition of authority'' because in that case, the addition is the saying of the Prophet (PBUH) which is mentioned by one narrator and omitted by another. But here it is quite different as the narrator of the Hadith himself is pointing out the addition made by him.

Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) took three people with him while Messenger of Allah (PBUH) took ten. Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) took his supper with the Prophet (PBUH) and stayed there till he offered the `Isha' prayers. After a part of the night had passed, he returned to his house. His wife said to him: "What has detained you from your guests?'' He said: "Have you not served supper to them?'' She said: "They refused to take supper until you come.'' [Abdur-Rahman (Abu Bakr's son) or the servants] presented the meal to them but they refused to eat. I (the narrator) hid myself out of fear. Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) (my father) rebuked me. Then he said to them: "Please eat. By Allah! I will never eat the meal.'' `Abdur-Rahman added: Whenever we took a morsel of the meal, the meal grew from underneath more than that morsel we had till everybody ate to his satisfaction; yet the remaining food was more than what was in the beginning. On seeing this, Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) called his wife and said: "O sister of Banu Firas! What is this?'' She said: "O pleasure of my eyes! The food has increased thrice in quantity.'' Then Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) started eating. He said: "My oath not to take the meal was because of Satan.'' He took a morsel handful from it and carried the rest to the Prophet (PBUH). That food remained with him. In those days there was a treaty between us and the pagans and when the period of that treaty elapsed, he (PBUH) divided us into twelve groups and every group was headed by a man.

Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) sent an espionage mission of ten men under the leadership of `Asim bin Thabit Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him). They proceeded till they reached Al-Had'ah, a place between `Usfan and Makkah and the news of their arrival reached a section of the tribe of Hudhail, called Banu Lihyan. About one hundred men, who were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks. When `A sim and his companions came to know of their pursuers, they took refuge in a safe place. The infidels encircled them and said to them: "Come down and surrender, and we promise and guarantee you that we will not kill anyone of you.'' `Asim bin Thabit (May Allah be pleased with him) said: "By Allah! I will not come down to be under the protection of disbelievers. O Allah! convey this news to our Prophet (PBUH).'' Then the infidels shot arrows at them till they killed `Asim. Three men came down relying on their promise and covenant. They were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathinah and another man. When the disbelievers captured them, they tied them up with the strings of their bows. The third of the captives said: "This is the beginning of first betrayal. By Allah! I will not go with you. I have a good example in these (martyrs).'' So they dragged him and tried to compel him to accompany them, but he refused. At last they killed him. They took Khubaib and Zaid bin Ad-Dathina with them and sold them as slaves in Makkah. This incident took place after the battle of Badr.(@)(@@) Khubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith bin `Amir bin Naufal bin `Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith in the battle of Badr. Khubaib remained a prisoner with those people for a few days till the sons of Al-Harith resolved to kill him.(@)(@@) When Khubaib (May Allah be pleased with him) got wind of this plot, he borrowed a razor from one of Al-Harith's daughters in order to remove his pubic hair. Her little son crawled towards Khubaib because of her carelessness. Later on, she saw her son on his thigh and the razor was in his hand. She got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the agitation on her face and said: "Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do that.'' She later remarked (after Al-Khubaib got martyred): "By Allah! I never saw a prisoner better than Khubaib.'' She added: "By Allah! I saw him once eating of a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was chained and there was no such fruit at that time in Makkah. Probably it was a boon which Allah bestowed upon Khubaib.''(@)(@@) When they took him out of the Haram of Makkah to kill him outside its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two Rak`ah of voluntary prayer. They allowed him and he offered two Rak`ah prayer. Then he said: "Had I not apprehended that you would think that I was afraid of death, I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah! Count their number; slay them one by one and spare not one of them.'' He then recited these poetic verses:(@)(@@) `I do not care how they kill me as long as I get martyred in the Cause of Allah as a Muslim. I received my death for Allah's sake. If Allah so desires, He will bless, the amputated limbs of the torn body.'(@)(@@) Then the son of Al-Harith killed him. It was Khubaib who set the tradition for any Muslim sentenced to death in captivity to offer two Rak`ah of voluntary prayer. On that day the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) informed his Companions of the martyrdom of Khubaib. Later on, when some disbelievers from Quraish were informed that `Asim had been martyred, they sent some people to fetch a significant part of his body to ascertain his death. (This was because) `Asim had killed one of their chiefs. So Allah sent a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady cloud, to hover over the body of `Asim and to shield him from their messengers, and thus they could not cut off anything from his body.(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari].(@)(@@) Commentary: "Raht'' means a group or party.

Allah knows better.(@)(@@) The incident reported in this Hadith has many miracles and marvels. For instance, according to his prayer, the news of his assassination was conveyed by Allah through Wahy to the Prophet (PBUH) on the very day when he was martyred and he (PBUH) informed his Companions about it.(@)(@@) Second, Allah provided Khubaib with grapes when they were out of season during his imprisonment.(@)(@@) Third, Allah sent wasps for the safety of `Asim's corpse.(@)(@@) Fourth, his enemies met with the evil end which he had imprecated for them.(@)(@@) This Hadith brings forth the following six points:(@)(@@) 1. If one's enemy shows strictness and oppression, then he should not accept the offer of protection from them even if he is killed as a result of this. One can, however, try to save his life if he sees some signs of leniency in the enemy's attitude.(@)(@@) 2. The matchless perseverance and steadfastness of the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) and their patience on the tyrannies perpetrated on them by their enemies.(@)(@@) 3. Even in the worst of circumstances, the Companion of the Prophet (PBUH) (i.e., Khubaib) maintained the best standard of morality and did not harm the enemy's child in any way.(@)(@@) 4. If the enemy is bent upon killing, then it is permissible to request them for permission to offer two Rak`ah of voluntary Salat because this act of Khubaib (May Allah be pleased with him) was upheld by the Prophet (PBUH).(@)(@@) 5. It is lawful to imprecate for oppressors and disbelievers.(@)(@@) There are many Ahadith on the validity of marvels and miracles which have been mentioned in the present book in different chapters.

He (PBUH) further said, "Shall I not guide you to the gates of goodness? Fasting is a screen (from Hell), charity extinguishes (i.e., removes) the sins as water extinguishes fire, and standing in prayers by a slave of Allah during the last third part of the night.'' Then he recited: "Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Rubb in fear and hope, and they spend (in charity in Allah's Cause) out of what We have bestowed on them.

Sumurah bin Jundub (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) very often used to ask his Companions, "Do any one of you has seen a dream?'' So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah willed to relate. One day he (PBUH) said, "Last night I had a vision in which two men (angels) came to me and woke me up and said to me, `Proceed!' I set out with them and we came across a man lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man's head, smashing it. When he struck him, the stone rolled away and he went after it to get it, and no sooner had he returned to this man, his head was healed and restored to its former condition. The thrower (of the rock) then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, `Subhan- Allah! Who are these?' They said: `Proceed, proceed.' So we proceeded and came to a man lying in a prone position and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man's mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck), and similarly tear his nose from front to back, and his eyes from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man's face and did just as he has done with the first side. He had hardly completed that (second) side when the first returned to its normal state. I said to my two companions, `Subhan-Allah! Who are these?' They said, `Proceed, proceed.' So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).'' I (the narrator) think the Prophet (PBUH) said, "In that oven there was much noise and voices.'' The Prophet (PBUH) added, "We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them they cried loudly. I asked, `Who are these?' They said to me, `Proceed, proceed.' And so we proceeded and came across a river.'' I (the narrator) think he said, "-- red like blood.'' The Prophet (PBUH) added, "And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold, while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. Then again he (the former) returned to him (the latter), and every time the former returned, he opened his mouth, and the latter threw a stone into his mouth, (and so on) the performance was repeated. I asked my two companions, `Who are these?' They replied, `Proceed, proceed.' And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire, and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my two companions, `Who is this (man).' They said to me, `Proceed, proceed!' So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colours. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man, and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen! I said to my two companions, `Who is this?' They replied, `Proceed, proceed.' So we proceeded till we came to a majestic, huge garden, greater and better than any garden I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, `Ascend up' and I ascended up.'' The Prophet (PBUH) added, "So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks, and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened; and we entered the city and found in it men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the most handsome person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen! My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared, and they came in the best shape.'' The Prophet (PBUH) further added, "My two companions said to me: `This place is the `Adn Jannah, and that is your place.' I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, `That palace is your place,' I said to them, `May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.' They replied, `As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day).' I said to them, `I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?' They replied, `We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon, whose head was being smashed with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Qur'an and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came upon, whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells lies that are spread all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses. And the man who was given a stone to swallow is the eater of Ar-Riba (usury), and the bad-looking man whom you saw near the fire, kindling it and going around it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell, and the tall man you saw in the garden is (Prophet) Abraham, and the children around him are those who died upon Al-Fitrah (the Islamic Faith of Monotheism).''' The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet (PBUH) , "O Messenger of Allah! What about the children of Al-Mushrikun (i.e., polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger Muhammad (PBUH))?'' The Prophet (PBUH) replied, "And also the children of Al-Mushrikun.'' The Prophet (PBUH) added: "My two companions added, `The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were these people who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them'.'' Another narration of Al-Bukhari is: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "One night two men came to me and took me to a blessed land.'' (The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) told of the same incident as above) and said, "After a while of walking we came upon a pit like an oven, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom with fire raging in it. When the flames rose up (the people in it) also rose up till they were about to come out; and when the fire subsided they, too, would go down with it. In it were naked men and women.'' (The remainder of the Hadith is the same as the above Hadith except that at the end of it, the Messenger of Allah said: "We came upon a river of blood in the middle of which there was a man standing, and at the bank of the river there was a man with plenty of stones before him...'' In this narration we also find: "They made me climb the tree and they made me enter an abode so beautiful the like of which I have never seen before. There (I saw) old men and youth.'' In this narration we also find: "`The first house you entered was the abode of the believers in general, and the other house was the abode of the martyrs. I am Jibril (Gabriel), and this is Mika'il. Raise your head.' I looked up and saw something like clouds. They said to me, `That is your abode.' I said, `Shall I enter it?' They said, `You have not completed your term of life yet. When you do, you will certainly enter it.''' [Al-Bukhari] Commentary: This Hadith has the following points: 1. Manifestation through dream of punishment of various evils, i.e., forgetting the Qur'an after having memorized it, not practising the teachings of the Qur'an, violating the precepts of the Qur'an after attaining their knowledge, slackness in offering obligatory Salat, lying, immoral acts, usury, etc. Strict warnings have been issued against all these evils, and the punishment to which they are liable have been mentioned in this Hadith. May Allah save us from them. 2. This Hadith also mentions the unique status of Prophet (PBUH) and the distinguished place of martyrs. 3. We also learn from this Hadith that Allah has made Hell for punishment and Jannah for reward. Muhammad (PBUH), the Last Prophet of Allah, was made to witness many scenes which demonstrated the retribution and reward of deeds done by people in their earthly life.(@)PageV01P1964(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 261 - باب بيان ما يجوز من الكذب(@)(@@) Chapter 261(@)(@@) Falsehood that is Permissible PageV01P1965 أعلم أن الكذب وإن كان أصله محرما فيجوز في بعض الأحوال بشروط قد أوضحتها في كتاب : الأذكار ( انظر باب النهي عن الكذب وبيان أقسامه من الأذكار ) ومختصر ذلك أن الكلام وسيلة إلى المقاصد . فكل مقصود محمود يمكن تحصيله بغير الكذب يحرم الكذب فيه وإن لم يمكن تحصيله إلا بالكذب جاز الكذب . ثم إن كان تحصيل ذلك المقصود مباحا كان الكذب مباحا وإن كان واجبا كان الكذب واجبا فإذا اختفى مسلم من ظالم يريد قتله أو أخذ ماله وأخفى ماله وسئل إنسان عنه وجب الكذب بإخفائه وكذا لو كان عنده وديعة وأراد ظالم أخذها وجب الكذب بإخفائها والأحوط في هذا كله أن يوري(@)(@@) ومعنى التورية : أن يقصد بعبارته مقصودا صحيحا ليس هو(@)(@@) كاذبا بالنسبة إليه وإن كان كاذبا في ظاهر اللفظ وبالنسبة إلى ما يفهمه المخاطب ولو ترك التورية وأطلق عبارة الكذب فليس بحرام في هذا الحال . واستدل العلماء بجواز الكذب في هذا الحال بحديث أم كلثوم رضي الله عنها أنها سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول : [ ليس الكذاب الذي يصلح بين الناس فينمي خيرا أو

An example of this is the case of a Muslim who hides himself or his money from a tyrant who is bent on killing him or taking his money from him. If one knows the whereabouts of this Muslim or his money and is asked about it, it is permissible to lie in this case to save a Muslim's life or his property, but it is better to give an equivocal answer, that is one which is not clear or definite in meaning, and that can be interpreted in more than one way in order to shun lying altogether. The sum and substance of discussion has been derived from the narration ascribed to Umm Kulthum (May Allah be pleased with her).

Similarly, the second wife should not invent false stories to give wrong impression of herself to the other wife. Nor should make false claims of greater love and attention of the husband only to incite the jealousy of the other one while the real position is far from that.

Abu Barzah Nadlah bin `Ubaid Al-Aslami (May Allah be pleased with him) said: A young woman was riding a she-camel on which there was the luggage of people. Suddenly she saw the Prophet (PBUH). The pass of the mountain became narrow for her people (because of fear). The young woman said to the she-camel: "Go ahead.'' When it did not move, she said, "O Allah! Curse it.'' The Prophet (PBUH) said, "The she-camel that has been cursed should not accompany us.''(@)(@@) [Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: Some people have taken this Hadith to mean that the she- camel cursed by the young woman was abandoned there and it was neither used for transport nor conveyance, as was the practice in the pre- Islamic period with she-camels which were let loose for free pasture for the polytheists' false gods, and nothing was allowed to be carried on them. Such she-camels were called as "As-Sa'ibah'' There is no justification for such interpretation because the she-camel was not set absolutely free like As-Sa'ibah. All that was done was that because of the curse, it was considered unworthy of the entourage company of the Prophet (PBUH). Except for this bar, it was valid for all other purposes. Thus, this Hadith proves that it is not permissible to associate with people who are given to sins and heresies in religion because they have been cursed. When one is not permitted to keep an animal which has been cursed, how can one possibly keep company with people who commit acts as a result of which they have been cursed.(@)PageV01P1983(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 265 - باب جواز لعن أصحاب المعاصي غير المعينين(@)(@@) Chapter 265(@)(@@) Justification of Cursing the Wrongdoers without Specifying one of them PageV01P1984 قال الله تعالى ( هود 18 ) : { ألا لعنة الله على الظالمين }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( الأعراف 44 ) : { فأذن مؤذن بينهم أن لعنة الله على الظالمين }(@)(@@) وثبت في الصحيح أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ لعن الله الواصلة والمستوصلة ] ( انظر الحديث رقم 1639 )(@)(@@) وأنه قال : [ لعن الله آكل الربا ] ( انظر الحديث رقم 1612 )(@)(@@) وأنه لعن المصورين ( انظر باب تحريم تصوير الحيوان )(@)(@@) وأنه قال : [ لعن الله من غير منار الأرض ] : أي حدودها(@)(@@) وأنه قال : [ لعن الله السارق يسرق البيضة ](@)(@@) وأنه قال : [ لعن الله من لعن والديه ] ( انظر الحديث رقم 338 )(@)(@@) و[ لعن الله من ذبح لغير الله ](@)(@@) وأنه قال : [ من أحدث فيها حدثا أو آوى محدثا فعليه لعنة الله والملائكة والناس أجمعين ] ( انظر الحديث رقم 1810 )(@)(@@) وأنه قال : [ اللهم العن رعلا وذكوان وعصية عصوا الله ورسوله ] وهذه ثلاث قبائل من العرب(@)(@@) وأنه قال : [ لعن الله اليهود اتخذوا قبور أنبيائهم مساجد ](@)(@@) وأنه لعن المتشبهين من الرجال بالنساء والمتشبهات من النساء بالرجال ( انظر الحديث رقم 1628 )(@)(@@) وجميع هذه الألفاظ في الصحيح بعضها في صحيحي البخاري ومسلم وبعضها في أحدهما وإنما قصدت الاختصار بالإشارة إليها . وسأذكر معظمها في أبوابها من هذا الكتاب إن شاء الله تعالى(@)(@@) Allah, the Exalted, says:(@)(@@) "No doubt! the Curse of Allah is on the Zalimun (polytheists, wrongdoers, oppressors).''

Thus, it is a false bid which is not at all intended for purchasing the thing which is being auctioned. The instructions given to the Muslims in this Hadith are meant to secure the honour of Muslims. Since, doubt without any reason, and search for defects and weaknesses go against the security of a Muslim's honour, Islam has strictly forbidden Muslims from them. Another purpose for forbidding such things is to consolidate Muslim brotherhood. For this reason, they have been forbidden from oppression, leaving their Muslim brothers in lurch, considering others humble, and from taking pride in worldly possessions. In fact, the life, property, and honour of a Muslim have been declared unlawful for all other Muslims. Increase in a bid without any intention of buying the thing being auctioned and bargain over a bargain have also been prohibited because they also create ill-will and enmity.(@)PageV01P2010(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1571 - وعن معاوية رضي الله عنه قال سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول : [ إنك(@)(@@) إن اتبعت عورات المسلمين أفسدتهم أو كدت أن تفسدهم ] حديث صحيح رواه أبو داود بإسناد صحيح(@)(@@) 1571.

This Hadith highlights the intensity of unlawfulness of Ar-Riba, or what has come to be called nowadays interest which can be judged from the fact that not only the person who charges it and the one who pays it are cursed but even those who write the documents and bear witness to the transaction are condemned although the latter two have no active part in the deal. They have been condemned for their mere co-operation in the matter of interest. Thus, we learn that even co-operation in the deal in which interest is involved is an invitation to the Curse and Wrath of Allah. The reason for such severity in the matter of interest is that Islam wants to create a society which is founded on fraternity, sympathy, selflessness and sacrifice. If someone is in need of money, the rich should fulfill his needs for the sake of Allah's Pleasure or give him a loan without interest. As against the Islamic system, this system of interest is based on selfishness, exploitation and suppression. In the interest-ridden societies, the affluent ones are not inclined to co-operate with the needy for the sake of Allah. All they are concerned with is their own interest. Their lust and greed are not reduced in the slightest measure even after draining the last drop of the blood of the poor. This is the reason why Shari`ah has forbidden interest of every kind and regarded it unlawful, no matter whether the loan is for the personal need or commercial requirements.(@)(@@) Some people say that there did not exist any practice of commercial loan in Arabia at that time and people used to borrow money for their personal needs only. On the basis of this plea, they say that the interest which has been forbidden by Islam relates to the latter form. For this reason, they hold that interest lawful which is charged on loan taken for industry and commerce. They contend that since the borrowers in industrial and commercial sectors make huge profits from such loans, how does it become unlawful if they pay the lender a small fixed annual amount against it? In their opinion, it is a right of the lender which should be paid to him on his wealth. But such arguments are totally wrong for two major reasons:(@)(@@) First, the assumption that there was no practice of commercial loans in Arabia is altogether baseless. Commercial loan was certainly in vogue in the Arab society and there is no point in debating this fact.(@)(@@) Second, nobody can say with certainty that the amount invested by a person in business will yield profit without fail because we see it every day that sometimes huge investments made in business and industry result in colossal loss, but the lending agency does not bother about it at all and it recovers from the borrower every penny of his loan and interest. Is this not the height of tyranny and selfishness? If it is supposed that there is no loss, even then the interest on loan substantially contributes to the increase in prices of goods. Whatever interest an industrialist pays on loan is added to the cost of his goods, which ultimately increases their prices and in turn adversely affects the purchasing capacity of the customers - the masses. This is the reason why Islam has closed this largest source of exploitation, suppression and tyranny by declaring every kind of interest unlawful.(@)(@@) It is very sad indeed that in emulating the western societies, Muslims have also founded their economy on the system of interest. The westernized rulers of the Muslim countries are not making any effort to emancipate their countries from this curse, nor do the people of these countries now have any passion to save themselves from it. In fact, a large majority of them borrow and lend money on interest through the bank without any regard to the Islamic injunctions in this respect.(@)(@@) Given below are some points for the consideration of those Muslims who want to protect their Faith and religion and save themselves from the curse of interest.(@)(@@) The word used for interest in the Qur'an is Ar-Riba which means excess. In Shari`ah, it is the measure of excess in one thing when two things are exchanged in some bargain; or in the case of a loan, an increased amount of the loan at the time of its payment. Ar-Riba is of two kinds:(@)(@@) First, Riba Al-Fadl: To take more in exchange of one commodity in the event of barter of two similar commodities.(@)(@@) Second, Riba An-Nasi'ah: To take a larger return of one thing while two identical things are bartered. But in this case the larger return is effected after a fixed period of time.(@)(@@) In Islamic jurisprudence, assets are of two types. One type is of commodities and the other is of the mode of price for exchanging commodities called Thaman Then every type has a class of varieties. For example, food grains are a type of assets and rice, wheat, etc., are its varieties. Similarly, silver, gold, etc., are varieties of the second type of assets. Coins, currency notes, company shares, etc., can also be considered varieties of this type in contemporary life.(@)(@@) This Hadith has injunctions in respect of both types of assets. Six things mentioned in the Hadith are gold, silver, wheat, barley, dates and salt. Some religious scholars have restricted the matters relating to interest to these six things only and do not regard increase or decrease in other things as usury, while going by analogy the majority of scholars and jurists have included other things also in this list. (For instance, all the food grains whether they are calculated in terms of weight or measure, or which have - like gold and silver - the quality of being Thaman, or according to some scholars and jurists which are capable of being stored).(@)(@@) Thus, to sum up, these two types of assets have four varieties:(@)(@@) 1. Commodities which are sold by weight.(@)(@@) 2. Commodities which are sold by measure.(@)(@@) 3. Commodities which can be stored.(@)(@@) 4. Commodities which are used as Thaman in sale and purchase.(@)(@@) In all such matters the position of interest-bearing and interest-free things would be as under:(@)(@@) 1. When commodities to be exchanged are of the same `type' and `variety,' any increase or decrease in them will be unlawful, as will be their sale on credit; for example, exchange of wheat with wheat and rice with rice. It is essential that these things are equal in measure and/or weight, and are in actual possession.(@)(@@) 2. If two things to be exchanged are of the same `type' but of a different `variety,' any increase or decrease in them is permissible. Their sale on credit is, however, not lawful. For instance, the exchange of one kilogram of silver with two grams of gold, or the barter of one kilo barley with half a kilo wheat, or the exchange of one dinar with four riyals. If such a bargain is on cash basis it will be fair, but any credit in this case is not correct.(@)(@@) 3. When the two things to be exchanged are not of the same `type' and are also different in `variety,' then any increase or decrease in them is permissible and their sale on credit is also allowed. For example, exchange of one kilogramme of wheat with a gram of gold, bargain of one kilogramme of dates with ten Tola (about 116 grams) silver. Any increase or decrease in them is permissible, as is their sale on credit(@)PageV01P2085(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 288 - باب تحريم الرياء(@)(@@) Chapter 288(@)Prohibition of Show-off PageV01P2086 قال الله تعالى ( البينة 5 ) : { وما

A man from the Ansar said, "Tell me about the brother of a woman's husband.'' He replied, "The brother of a woman's husband is death.''(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: This Hadith tells us an extremely important point in respect of the veil about which the majority of Muslims are unaware or negligent. The point that it tells us that a woman must observe the veil from the real brothers, cousins etc., of her husband because their visits in her home are very frequent and there may occur several occasions when they come across each other alone. For this reason, there are greater chances of mischief with them. This explains why the husband's male relatives have been regarded as "death'', that is from the religious point of view they are fatal. In other words, if they commit the mischief, it will prove fatal because in an Islamic state this crime is punishable by Rajm (stoning to death). This can also be fatal in another way. If the husband begins to suspect that his wife has illicit relations with someone else, he might kill her or divorce her out of his sense of honour. Even in case of divorce, her life will become desolate. Another meaning of it can be that one should be as much afraid of meeting such women in seclusion with whom any kind of contact is not permissible as one is afraid of death.(@)(@@) When a woman is required to observe the veil from the real brothers of her husband, why would it not be essential to observe the veil from the husband's friends. Slackness in this matter is also very common nowadays. Although the dangerous consequences of this fashion come to our notice everyday through newspapers, people do not learn any lesson from them, and the fashion of non-observance of the veil is spreading fast like an epidemic.

This Hadith considers the act of those who violate the Mujahidun's trust by molesting their wives in any way, taking advantage of their absence, as a very grave sin, because Mujahidun defend the Faith and strive hard to raise the flag of Islam high.

All of them make predictions about the future. Kahin would overhear some jinn and disclose the secret to people which would sometimes prove true, because the jinn's source of information was Satan who sometimes stole away some information from the angels. But after the annunciation of the Prophet (PBUH) it was made impossible for jinns and satans to overhear anything in the skies. Moreover, Kahin and others of his ilk would make predictions on the basis of certain signs and circumstantial evidence which could go wrong or right. This is so even to this day. Astrological prediction is also a form of foretelling but this is often wrong. Al-`Irafah, or what is known to be as divination is also an indication of some future occurrence on the basis of certain causes and events. All the three occult arts supplement each other and also take the help of similar other things. In other words, these are all different forms of soothsaying. Geomancy also tries to tell about the invisible future. At- Tarq is the art of taking omen by striking birds with gravel on their wings or by throwing barley, etc., before them. In the latter formula, if a bird flies towards the right side, it would be a good omen; and if it goes towards the left it will be a bad one.

There are still some men among us who visit the soothsayers to consult them (on matters relating to the future).'' He (PBUH) replied, "Do not visit them.''

This Hadith has already appeared earlier [Hadith No 701]. "These are the ideas which come up in their minds'' means that sometimes something appears and one's mind at once takes it as a bad omen. This is something instinctive and natural and one is not accountable for it. But if one acts in accordance with that omen then what he does is wrong and is, therefore, forbidden. For this reason, the Prophet (PBUH) said, "(i.e., these things) should not prevent them from pursuing their works.''(@)(@@) 2. The drawing of a line mentioned in this Hadith is different from the drawing of lines in `Iyafah mentioned earlier. Moreover, that was an act of a Prophet which was done by him in the light of Wahy sent to him by Allah and, therefore, was certainly correct. But now, nobody possesses that knowledge and cannot, therefore, be adopted. The statement of the Prophet (PBUH) that: "The line which agrees with the line drawn by that Prophet would be correct'' was by way of elucidation. It does not mean that that act can also be done by anyone today, for how can it be done without knowing its principles. How did that Prophet of Allah draw that line? What were its principles? Since that knowledge has passed away with that Prophet, it is now no longer valid, nor would it be fruitful.(@)(@@) Who was the Prophet who did it?

The phrase "Not the transmission of disease of one person to another'' either negates the idea that disease can travel from one person to another or it signifies that one should not attribute the illness of one person to the illness of another. The right approach is that one should think that a person falls ill with the Will of Allah. This does not mean that this Hadith denies the infectious character of certain diseases but it attempts to correct one's belief, namely that if Allah wills something, it will certainly occur. Thus, this Hadith proves that even in infectious diseases it is not the disease itself which is the real cause but the Preordainment and Will of Allah.(@)(@@) 2. Similar is the case of bad omens. These have no significance at all. If any suspicion crosses one's mind by seeing something, he should neither attach any importance to it nor act what the suspicion demands. Good omen is permissible for the reason that it inclines one to associate good hopes with Allah, which is a highly commendable tendency. Thus, it also induces one to always utter something nice and to listen to what is nice so that in both cases it occasions good omens. One should always abstain from saying what is repulsive to the listeners and tends to be a bad omen.(@)PageV01P2167(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1675 - وعن ابن عمر رضي الله عنهما قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم

What will be the quantity of the average food that is to be served to the ten person by way of expiation? We do not find any elaboration of this in any Hadith. Some `Ulama' have stated that it means meals of the day and night. Some scholars have taken support of a Hadith and suggested that it should be one Mudd (about half kilogram) per head because this is the quantity which the Prophet (PBUH) prescribed as expiation for sexual intercourse with one's wife during fasting. The expiation prescribed by him was 15 Sa` dates which were to be divided among sixty poor fellows. Since one Sa` consists of four Mudd, the quantity of food, without curry, for ten persons would be six kilograms. (Ibn Kathir). This means that it would be six kilograms of flour, or rice, or dates etc. Thus, even if ten poor persons are served with an average meal, it would be a substantial quantity. Allah Alone knows what is correct.(@)PageV01P2226(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 318 - باب كراهة الحلف في البيع وإن كان صادقا(@)(@@) Chapter 318(@)(@@) Abomination of Swearing in Transaction(@)PageV01P2227(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1720 - عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول : [ الحلف منفقة للسلعة ممحقة للكسب ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) 1720.

It should also be borne in mind that when holding a conversation which is disliked or forbidden at other times becomes even more so at this particular time (i.e., after `Isha' prayer). Imam An-Nawawi's contention that things like academic discussion, talking to a guest, discussing the lives of the pious etc., are not only permissible but desirable, is also subject to the condition that such an activity does not involve the risk of losing the Fajr prayer. If one spends so much time in such activities that he is likely to miss the Fajr prayer, then the permission to hold academic discussion becomes doubtful.(@)PageV01P2271(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1747 - وعن ابن عمر رضي الله عنهما أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم صلى في آخر حياته فلما سلم قال : [ أرأيتكم ليلتكم هذه فإن على رأس مائة سنة لا يبقى ممن هو على ظهر الأرض اليوم أحد ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) 1747.

They have taken the plea that if there is no risk of losing the first Rak`ah, it is permissible to continue the Sunnah of Fajr prayer. Their plea is against the present Hadith.

In the opinion of some `Ulama' this is prohibited if the merchandise is valuable and the villager is not aware of its real worth and the urbanite wants to exploit his ignorance. But, on the contrary, if the proposal is for the welfare of the villager and the urbanite merely wants the owner to receive its due price then the offer is admissible. The first proposition is prohibited because that will cause a loss to the villager; the second is permissible as it is a well-meaning offer.(@)(@@) "A person in the city should not make a deal on behalf of a villager'' has been interpreted by `Abdullah bin `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) to mean that he should not work as a broker for a villager because in that case he will be interested to sell it on a higher price in order to have a better commission in the deal, which will unnecessarily raise its cost.(@)(@@) On one side, the purchase of goods coming from outside has been prohibited before its arrival on the market so that nobody can exploit the ignorance of the outsiders, and on the other side, villagers are enjoined to sell their goods themselves so that the commission of the broker does not increase the price of the goods.

If the one who is praised has perfect Faith and confidence and is endowed with the gift of knowledge by Allah and has control over his self and thereby he is not likely to go astray by praise, then praising him is neither unlawful nor disgusting. But if he is vulnerable to praise then praising him in his presence is abhorred. Ahadith in prohibition of praise support this point of view. While one of the Ahadith, which are in favour of praise, relates to the occasion when the Prophet (May Allah be pleased with him) said to Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (May Allah be pleased with him): "I hope that you will also be among them,'' that is "You will be one of hose who will be called from every gate of Jannah.''

Another Hadith on the issue relates to the event when the Prophet (PBUH) said to Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him): "You are not one of them.'' What it signified was that "You are not one of those who keep their trousers below their ankles out of sheer pride.'' (See, Sahih Al-Bukhari, Manaqib Abu Bakr).

He sought their advice and told them that an epidemic had broken out in Ash-Sham. There was a difference of opinion whether they should proceed further or retreat to their homes in such a situation. Some of them said: "You have set forth to fight the enemy, and therefore you should not go back;'' whereas some of them said: "As you have along with you many eminent Companions of Messenger of Allah (PBUH), we would not advice you to set forth to the place of the plague (and thus expose them deliberately to a danger).'' `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: "You can now go away.'' He said: "Call to me the Ansar (the Helpers).'' So I called them to him, and he consulted them and they differed in their opinions as well. He said: "Now, you may go.'' He again said: "Call the old (wise people) of the Quraish who had emigrated before the conquest of Makkah.'' I called them. `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) consulted them in this issue and not even two persons among them differed in the opinions. They said: "We think that you should go back along with the people and do not take them to this scourge. `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) made an announcement to the people, saying: "In the morning I intend to go back, and I want you to do the same.'' Abu 'Ubaidah bin Al- Jarrah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: "Are you going to run away from the Divine Decree?'' Thereupon `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: "O Abu 'Ubaidah !

The opinion given by the groups of Ansar and Muhajirun before this Ijtihad was also based on some principles of Shari`ah: those who had advised not to return had evinced submission to the Will of Allah and their absolute trust in Him, and the other group which had preferred the way of precaution had suggested to avoid any such action which could prove harmful.(@)(@@) Although such precautionary measures could not save them from the Divine Decree, they decided to take all possible precautions because this is what is ordained by Allah.

During the pre-Islamic period, keeping quiet was also considered as a sort of worship or devotion to God. Islam does not allow such ascetic ceremonies and extravagance. So such actions are forbidden. Further it has been stressed that instead of keeping quiet one should engage in good actions, such as enjoining good, forbidding evil, entertaining a guest, remembering Allah and glorifying Him. However, it is better to keep quiet rather than telling lies, indulging in indecent talk or backbiting.(@)PageV01P2362(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 367 - باب تحريم انتساب الإنسان إلى غير أبيه وتوليه غير مواليه(@)(@@) Chapter 367(@)Prohibition of attributing wrong Fatherhood(@)PageV01P2363(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1802 - عن سعد بن أبي وقاص رضي الله عنه أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ من ادعى إلى غير أبيه وهو يعلم أنه غير أبيه فالجنة عليه حرام ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) 1802.

He unrolled the scroll which showed a list of what sort of camels to be given as blood-money, and other legal matters relating to killing game in the sanctuary of Makkah and the expiation thereof. In it was also written: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: `Al-Madinah is a sanctuary from `Air to Thaur (mountains). He who innovates in this territory new ideas in Islam, commits a sin therein, or shelters the innovators, will incur the Curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and Allah will accept from him neither repentance nor a ransom on the Day of Resurrection. The asylum (pledge of protection) granted by any Muslim (even of the) lowest status is to be honoured and respected by all other Muslims, and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect (by violating the pledge) will incur the Curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people; and Allah will accept from him neither repentance nor a ransom on the Day of Resurrection.

This Hadith also establishes that the claim that `Ali (May Allah be pleased with him) was given some specific knowledge of Khilafah (caliphate), which was not given to anybody else is also false.

An-Nawwas bin Sam`an (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: One morning the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) made a mention of Dajjal, and he described him to be insignificant and at the same time described him so significant that we thought he was on the date-palm trees (i.e., nearby). When we went to him (the Prophet (PBUH)) in the evening, he perceived the sign of fear on our faces. He said, "What is the matter with you?'' We said: "O Messenger of Allah, you talked about Dajjal this morning raising your voice and lowering it until we thought he was hiding in the palm-trees grove: He said: "Something other than Dajjal make worry about you. If he appears while I am with you, I will defend you against him. But if he appears after I die, then everyone of you is his own defender. Allah is the One Who remains after me to guide every Muslim. Dajjal will be a young man with very curly hair with one eye protruding (with which he cannot see). I compare (his appearance) to that of Al-`Uzza bin Qatan. He who amongst you survives to see him, should recite over him the opening Ayat of Surat Al-Kahf (i.e., Surat 18: Verses 1-8). He will appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and will spread mischief right and left. O slaves of Allah! Remain adhered to the truth.'' We asked: "O Messenger of Allah! How long will he stay on the earth?'' He said, "For forty days. One day will be like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week and the rest of the days will be like your days.'' We said: "O Messenger of Allah! Will one day's Salat (prayer) suffice for the Salat of that day which will be equal to one year?'' Thereupon he said, "No, but you must make an estimate of time and then offer Salat.'' We said: "O Messenger of Allah! How quickly will he walk upon the earth?'' Thereupon he said, "Like cloud driven by the wind (i.e., very quickly). He will come to the people and call them to his obedience and they will affirm their faith in him and respond to him. He will then give command to the sky and it will send its rain upon the earth and he will then send his command to the earth and it will grow vegetation. Then in the evening their pasturing animals will come to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched. He will then come to another people and invite them, but they will reject him and he will leave them, in barren lands and without any goods and chattels! He would then walk through the waste land and say to it: `Bring forth your treasures', and the treasures will come out and follow him like swarms of bees. He will then call a person brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and make these pieces lie at a distance, which is generally between the archer and his target. He will then call that young man and he will come forward, laughing, with his face gleaming out of joy; and it will be at this very time that Allah will send `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) who will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damascus, wearing two garments lightly dyed and placing his hands on the wings of two angels. When he will lower his head, there would fall drops of water from his head, and when he will raise it up, drops like pearls would scatter from it. Every disbeliever who will find his (i.e., `Isa's) smell will die and his smell will reach as far as he will be able to see. He will then search for Dajjal until he will catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd (village near Jerusalem), and will kill him. Then the people, whom Allah will have protected, will come to `Isa son of Maryam, and he will wipe their faces and will inform them of their ranks in Jannah, and it will be under such conditions that Allah will reveal to `Isa these words: `I have brought forth from amongst my slaves such people against whom none will be able to fight, so take these people safely to the mountain.' And then Allah will send Ya'juj and Ma'juj (Gog and Magog people) and they will sworn down from every slope. The first of them will pass the Lake Tabariyah (near the Dead Sea in Palestine) and drink all its water. And when the last of them will pass, he will say: `There was once water there.' Prophet `Isa (PBUH) and his companions will then be so much hard-pressed that the head of an ox will be dearer to them than one hundred dinar, and `Isa along with his companions, will make supplication to Allah, Who will send insects which will attack their (Ya'juj and Ma'juj people) neck until they all will perish like a single person. Prophet, `¦sa and his companions will then come down and they will not find in the earth as much space as a single span which would not be filled with their corpses and their stench. Prophet `Isa and his companions will then again beseech Allah, Who will send birds whose necks will be like those of Bactrian camels, and they will carry them and throw them where Allah will desire. Then Allah will send down rain which will spare no house in the city or in the countryside. It would wash away the earth until it appears like a mirror. Then the earth will be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessings; and as a result of this, there will grow such a big pomegranate that a group of people will eat from it and seek shelter under its skin. Milk will be so blessed that the milk of one she-camel will suffice for a large company and the cow will give so much milk, that it will suffice for a whole tribe. The sheep will give so much milk that the whole family will be able to drink out of that, and at that time Allah will send a pleasant wind which will soothe people even under their armpits, and will take the life of every Muslim and true believer, and only the wicked will survive. They will commit adultery in public like asses and the Resurrection Day will be held.''(@)(@@) [Muslim].(@)(@@) Commentary: In the above statement we find details about the signs of the Day of Resurrection, the appearance of Dajjal (Antichrist), the coming of Prophet `Isa - son of Maryam, and the appearance of Gog and Magog people.

Some people say that it refers to the calamities and troubles of the Day of Judgement.

As believers, we must confirm Allah's all Qualities which He has stated in the Qur'an or mentioned through His Messenger (PBUH) without changing them or ignoring them completely or twisting their meanings or giving resemblance to any of the created things. What is meant by the uncovering of the Shin of Allah is something we can neither understand nor describe. We can only believe in it without understanding the real explanation of it, in the same way we believe in the Eye or Ear of Allah. We should believe in all these things as mentioned in the Qur'an and Hadith without trying to go into the explanation. This is the view of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah to which we should stick.

The reason is that in the bodily worship, acting on the behalf of others is not permitted. As one cannot act or perform any bodily worship on behalf of others, similarly it is not allowed to do so after somebody's death. However, if in any particular case, there is a ruling in the Qur'an or Sunnah then in that particular matter deputizing would be allowed. In such case the permission should be limited to that particular matter only. For example it is specifically mentioned in the Hadith that the Wali, i.e., the guardian or inheritor of the dead person can observe the fasting of vow taken by the deceased person to Allah. However, no offering of other bodily worship, such as Salat, will be permitted on behalf of the deceased person.(@)PageV01P2426(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1859 - وعن عوف بن مالك بن الطفيل أن عائشة رضي الله عنها حدثت أن عبد الله بن الزبير رضي الله عنهما قال في بيع أو عطاء أعطته عائشة رضي الله عنها : والله لتنتهين عائشة أو لأحجرن عليها قالت : أهو قال هذا ؟ قالوا نعم قالت : هو لله علي نذر أن لا أكلم ابن الزبير أبدا فاستشفع ابن الزبير إليها حين طالت الهجرة فقالت : لا والله لا أشفع فيه أبدا ولا أتحنث إلى نذري فلما طال ذلك على ابن الزبير كلم المسور بن مخرمة وعبد الرحمن بن الأسود بن عبد يغوث وقال لهما : أنشدكما الله لما أدخلتماني على عائشة رضي الله عنها فإنها لا يحل لها أن تنذر قطيعتي فأقبل به المسور وعبد الرحمن حتى استأذنا على عائشة فقالا : السلام عليك ورحمة الله وبركاته أندخل ؟ قالت عائشة : ادخلوا قالوا : كلنا ؟ قالت : نعم ادخلوا كلكم ولا تعلم أن معهما ابن الزبير فلم دخلوا دخل ابن الزبير الحجاب فاعتنق عائشة رضي الله عنها وطفق يناشدها ويبكي وطفق المسور وعبد الرحمن يناشدانها إلا كلمته وقبلت منه ويقولان أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم نهي عما قد عملت من الهجرة ولا يحل لمسلم أن يهجر أخاه فوق ثلاث ليال فلما أكثروا على عائشة من التذكرة والتحريج طفقت تذكرهما وتبكي وتقول : إني نذرت والنذر شديد فلم يزالا بها حتى كلمت ابن الزبير وأعتقت في نذرها ذلك أربعين رقبة وكانت تذكر نذرها بعد ذلك فتبكي حتى تبل دموعها خمارها . رواه البخاري(@)(@@) 1859. `Auf bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) said: `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) as told that `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair (May Allah be pleased with them) had said in respect of selling of a gift which was presented to her: "By Allah! If `Aishah does not stop this kind of thing, I will declare her incompetent to administer her property.'' `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) asked: "Did He (`Abdullah bin Az-Zubair) say so?'' The people said: "Yes.'' `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: "I vow it before Allah that I will never speak to Ibn Az-Zubair.'' When this desertion lasted long, `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair sought intercession with her, but she said: "By Allah I will not accept the intercession of anyone for him, and I will not commit a sin of breaking my vow.'' When this state of affairs was prolonged, Ibn Az-Zubair felt it hard on him. He said to Al-Miswar bin Makhramah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin Yaghut: "I beseech you in the Name of Allah that you should take me to `Aishah because it is unlawful for her to vow to sever relations with me.'' So Al-Miswar and `Abdur-Rahman took him with them. They sought her permission, saying: "As-salamu `alaika wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu! Shall we come in?'' `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: "Come in,'' They asked: "All of us?'' She said: "All of you,'' not knowing that Ibn Az-Zubair was also with them. So, when they entered, Ibn Az-Zubair entered the screened place and got hold of `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her), his aunt. He was requesting her to forgive him and wept. Al-Miswar and `Abdur-Rahman also pleaded on his behalf and requested her to speak to him and to accept his repentance. They said to her: "The Prophet (PBUH) forbade to cut off relationship because it is unlawful for any Muslim not to talk to his (Muslim) brother (or sister, for that matter) for more than three (days).'' So when they persisted in urging and reminding her of the superiority of having good relation with kith and kin, she began to weep, saying: "I have made a vow which is a matter of very serious nature.'' They persisted in their appeal till she spoke with `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, and she freed forty slaves as an expiation for breaking her vow. Later on, whenever she remembered her vow, she would weep so much that her veil would become wet with tears.(@)(@@) [Al-Bukhari].(@)(@@) Commentary: `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair (May Allah be pleased with him) was the real nephew of `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her). She had made a vow that she would not talk to her nephew. She thought that such an oath was permissible as her nephew (the then governor of Makkah) had shown his intention to put a ban on the spending of `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her). In his opinion, she was spending very lavishly in charity. Later `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair (May Allah be pleased with him) realized his mistake and went to his aunt to seek forgiveness along with two persons as recommenders. After this, it was proper for her to break her oath and resume her relations with him. The expiation for breaking a vow is the same as that of breaking an oath, i.e., to feed ten indigent people on a scale of the average for the food of one's family, or cloth them, or give a slave his freedom. If one cannot afford any of these things, then he should fast for three days.

In this narration, the greatness and superiority of the Prophet (PBUH) has been described. On the Day of Resurrection when the great Prophets would not dare to speak or request leniency for mankind, only Muhammad (PBUH) would intercede for the people and request for mercy by the Permission of Allah. The first request which he will make would be that accountability may be started, so that the people may be freed as soon as possible from the hardships and troubles of the Day of Resurrection. This part of the Hadith has not been mentioned in this narration; but it has been described in other narrations. This would be a general request.(@)(@@) The second intercession will be for his own Ummah. This will take place in several stages. Here, the first stage has been mentioned.

The real reason for this attitude of theirs is that they are on such high pedestal of greatness and piety that even a slight slip of theirs which does come under the boundary of unworthiness would be felt by them to be very significant. This is just like the proverb which says that even the nice action of the pious ones are considered to be the blemishes and defects for the friends of Allah. Similar is the case with the Prophets, they excused themselves from advocating their case before Allah because of their insignificant slips.(@)(@@) 3. Special reference may be made of the three statements of Prophet Ibrahim which were apparently not according to the outward facts, so they have been described as `not factual'. In reality they were not mis- statements, but only a way of convincing the people about the basic universal truth, and making them realize their misunderstanding. These three are mentioned in a long Hadith narrated on the authority of Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him): Ibrahim (PBUH) did not tell a lie except on three occasions. Twice for the sake of Allah when he said, "I am sick'' (37:89) and he said, "(I have not done this) but the big idol had done it.'' (21:63) (The third was) that while Ibrahim and Sarah (his wife) were going (on a journey) they passed by (the territory of) a tyrant from among the tyrants. Someone said to the tyrant, "This man (i.e., Ibrahim) is accompanied by a very charming lady.'' So, he sent for Ibrahim and asked him about Sarah, saying, "Who is this lady?'' Ibrahim said, "She is my sister.'' Ibrahim went to Sarah and said, "O Sarah! There are no believers on the surface of the earth except you and I. This man asked me about you and I told him that you are my sister. So do not contradict my statement...'' (Al-Bukhari, vol. 4, Hadith No. 578)(@)(@@) The idolaters invited Ibrahim to join them in their celebrations outside the city, but he refused, claiming that he was sick. When he was left alone, he came to their idols and broke them. When the idolaters questioned him, he claimed that he had not destroyed their idols but the chief idol had, which Ibrahim left undisturbed and on whose shoulder he had put an axe to lay the accusation on it. To conclude, Ibrahim, like all other Prophets is free from sins, but the three acts which he made in good faith were to guide his people to the truth and to save his wife from the evil of the then tyrant.(@)PageV01P2434(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1867 - وعن ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما قال : جاء إبراهيم صلى الله عليه وسلم بأم إسماعيل وبابنها إسماعيل وهي ترضعه

Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Ibrahim (PBUH) brought his wife and her son Isma`il (PBUH), while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`bah under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. In those days, there was no human being in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Isma`il's mother followed him saying: "O Ibrahim! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?'' She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him: "Has Allah commanded you to do so?'' He said: "Yes.'' She said: "Then He will not neglect us.'' She returned while Ibrahim proceeded onwards. Having reached the Thaniya, where they could not see him, he faced Ka`bah, raised his both hands and supplicated: "O our Rubb! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka`bah at Makkah) in order, O our Rubb, that they may perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as- Salat). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.'' (14:37).(@)(@@) Isma`il's mother went on suckling Isma`il and drinking from the water which she had. When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at Isma`il, tossing in agony. She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of As-Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from As-Safa, and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble till she crossed the valley and reached Al-Marwah mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between As-Safa and Al-Marwah) seven times.'' Ibn `Abbas further related: The Prophet (PBUH) said, "This is the source of the tradition of the Sa`y - i.e., the going of people between the two mountains. When she reached Al-Marwah (for the last time), she heard a voice and she exclaimed: `Shshs!' (Silencing herself) and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said: `O (whoever you may be) You have made me hear your voice; have you any succour for me?' And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or with his wing), till water flowed out from that place. She started to make something like of a basin around it, using her hands in this way and began to fill her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out until she had scooped some of it.'' The Prophet (PBUH) further said, "May Allah bestow mercy on Isma'il's mother! Had she let the Zamzam flow without trying to control it (or had she not scooped in that water) while filling her water-skin, Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.'' The Prophet (PBUH) further added, "Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her: `Do not be afraid of being neglected, for this is the site on which the House of Allah will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah will never let neglected His people.' The House of Allah (the Ka`bah) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She continued living in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum passed by her and her child. As they were coming from through the way of Kada`, in the lower part of Makkah where they saw a bird that had a habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said: `This bird must be flying over water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.' They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came towards the water.'' The Prophet (PBUH) added, "Isma`il's mother was sitting near the water. They asked her: `Do you allow us to stay with you?' She replied: `Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.' They agreed to that.'' The Prophet (PBUH) further said, "Isma`il's mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them. The child (i.e., Isma`il) grew up and learnt Arabic from them (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty, they gave him one of their daughters in marriage. After Isma`il's mother had died, Ibrahim came after Isma`il's marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Isma`il there. When he asked Isma`il's wife about him, she replied: `He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied complaining to him: `We are living in hardship, misery and destitution.' He said: `When your husband returns, convey my salutations to him and tell him to change the threshold of the door of his house.' When Isma`il came, he seemed to have perceived something unusual. He asked his wife: `Did anyone visit you?' She replied: `Yes, an old man of such and such description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and, I told him that we were living in hardship and poverty.' Thereupon Isma`il said: `Did he advise you anything?' She replied: `Yes, he told me to convey his salutations to you and to change the threshold of your door.' Isma`il said: `That was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.' So Isma`il divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (Jurhum). Then Ibrahim stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them again but did not find Isma`il. So he came to Isma`il's wife and asked her about him. She said: `He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Ibrahim asked her about their sustenance and living: `How are you getting on?' She replied: `We are prosperous and well off.' Then she praised Allah, the Exalted. Ibrahim asked: `What kind of food do you eat?' She said: `Meat.' He said: `What do you drink?' She said: `Water.' He said, `O Allah! Bless their meat and water!''' The Prophet (PBUH) added, "At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.'' The Prophet (PBUH) further said, "If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected because these things do not suit him unless he lives in Makkah.'' The Prophet (PBUH) added, "Then Ibrahim said to Isma`il's wife, `When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his door.' When Isma`il came back, he asked his wife: `Did anyone call on you?' She replied: `Yes, a good looking old man came to me.' She praised him and added: `He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in good condition.' Isma`il asked her: `Did he give you a piece of advice?' She said: `Yes, he told me to convey his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your door.' On that Isma`il said: `He was my father and you are the threshold of the door. He has ordered me to keep you with me.' Then Ibrahim stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them afterwards. He saw Isma`il under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibrahim, he rose up to welcome him, and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father. Ibrahim said: `O Isma`il! Allah has given me an order.' Isma`il said: `Do what your Rubb has commanded you to do.' Ibrahim asked: `Will you help me?' Isma`il said: `I will help you.' Ibrahim said: `Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.''' The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) added, "Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e., Ka`bah). Isma`il brought the stones and Ibrahim was building (the house). When the walls became high, Isma`il brought stone and placed it for Ibrahim who stood over it and carried on building the House, while Isma`il was handing over the stones to him, both of them prayed: `O our Rubb! Accept this service from us!

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim] Commentary: Al-Manna is the famous kind of food which Allah bestowed upon Banu Israel. As-Salwa was a kind of bird resembling the quail. It was slaughtered and then eaten. Al-Manna was a sweet substance which appeared on the trees or stones. It was sweet like honey and after drying, it took the form of gum. According to others, it was honey or sweet water (Tafsir Ahsan-ul-Bayan). The truffle is similar to Al-Manna. This means that as Banu Israel were given food without toil, so we find truffle in nature without effort. The juice of truffle is useful in curing some diseases of the eye. This prescription was suggested by the Prophet (PBUH). It is surely beneficial.(@)PageV01P2436(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) | AUTO 19- كتاب الاستغفار(@)(@@) Book Nineteen: The Book of Forgiveness(@)PageV01P2437(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) || AUTO 371 - باب(@)(@@) Chapter 371(@)(@@) Seeking Forgiveness PageV01P2438 قال الله تعالى ( محمد 19 ) : { واستغفر لذنبك وللمؤمنين والمؤمنات }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( النساء 106 ) : { واستغفر الله إن الله كان غفورا رحيما }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( النصر 3 ) : { فسبح بحمد ربك واستغفره إنه كان توابا }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( آل عمران 15 ) : { للذين اتقوا عند ربهم جنات } إلى قوله عز وجل { والمستغفرين بالأسحار }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( النساء 110 ) : { ومن يعمل سوءا أو يظلم نفسه ثم يستغفر الله يجد الله غفورا رحيما }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( الأنفال 33 ) : { وما كان الله ليعذبهم وأنت فيهم وما كان الله معذبهم وهم يستغفرون }(@)(@@) وقال تعالى ( آل عمران 135 ) : { والذين إذا فعلوا فاحشة أو ظلموا أنفسهم ذكروا الله فاستغفروا لذنوبهم ومن يغفر الذنوب إلا الله ولم يصروا على ما فعلوا وهم يعلمون }(@)(@@) والآيات في الباب كثيرة معلومة(@)(@@) Allah, the Exalted, says:(@)(@@) "And ask forgiveness for your sin...''

Similarly, her pulse and blood pressure are also altered. Females are also more prone to hysteria. For these reasons, the Qur'an has declared that when you have to appoint or choose witnesses among women, you should choose two in place of one man. Modern researches have proved this rule to be correct on the basis of biology, psychology and embryology.(@)(@@) Again we know that physically speaking, the female has been named as the weaker sex. For these reasons, females have been excused from earning their livelihood. For earning livelihood, one may have to go out and work hard. Women have been exempted from this duty because of their biological differences and other considerations of Shari`ah. Present-day women who are ignorant of Islam and modern researches are not prepared to accept these scientifically and religiously proved facts. The West claims equality between the sexes. But this equality has not been established so far. Today all the important posts are occupied by males and all the international policies are framed by them alone. Even matters pertaining to women are decided by them. They have mostly relegated them to the posts of workers, secretaries and stenographers for their sexual satisfaction and enjoyment. After a struggle for hundred years, their condition today proves that they are the weaker sex.(@)(@@) So, it is both beneficial and more respectful for her to limit herself to the sphere of action suggested for her by Islam.

Similarly, Jumu`ah means that people will gather there for a time period equal to that of Jumu`ah, as there will be no sun, nor night and day. Another speciality of Jannah is that the beauty and charm of men and women will go on increasing and so the love and affection between husbands and wives will also keep on progressing and increasing. It will be just the opposite of what happens here in this world.(@)PageV01P2462(@)(@@)(@@)(@@) ||| AUTO 1890 - وعن سهل بن سعد رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال : [ إن أهل الجنة ليتراءون الغرف في الجنة كما تتراءون الكوكب في السماء ] متفق عليه(@)(@@) 1890.

However, we cannot see Him in this world with these worldly eyes. The reason is that, as Imam Malik says, these eyes are just temporary and they cannot bear the Sight of Allah. This is why the research scholars claim that the Prophet (PBUH) did not actually see Allah during his journey to the heavens; he only talked to Allah by way of Revelation. The saying of `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) also proves this contention. However, it would be possible to see Allah in Jannah as everything there will be eternal and indestructible.

Charity and prayer are two permissible forms of the transmission of blessing to the dead. But rites like `Qul' and `Chehlum' are all of Hindu origin to which the ignorant Muslims have taken a fancy. Similarly, Qur'an reading meant to transmit reward to a dead man's soul is against the Prophet's example. All such observances are of no use to the dead. Only scriptural channels can be beneficial to them and they are only two - prayer and charity. But only that charity counts which comes from the children of the dead and the Hadith too has specified it. Obviously, almsgiving by any other person than the offspring cannot be considered rightful or rewarding to the dead.
